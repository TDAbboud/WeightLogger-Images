Weight Logger Application with Images

Main Features:
   - CoreData
   - Adding images to CoreData
   - Threading for UIImagePickerController

This code is an extension of the WeightLogger project on my other repos. This extension implements adding a full screen/thumbnail image to CoreData. We then display the thumbnail image in a custom UITableViewCell, which when pressed will display the full-screen image. I have also included some GCD code in the UIImagePickerController delegate methods, to help improve memory performances.
