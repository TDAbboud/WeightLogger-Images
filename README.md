Weight Logger - Images
=============


Main Features:
-------
- CoreData
- Adding images to CoreData
- Threading for UIImagePickerController


This is an extension of the [WeightLogger](https://github.com/TDAbboud/WeightLogger) project. This extension adds a full screen/thumbnail image to CoreData. We then display the thumbnail image in a custom UITableViewCell, which when pressed will display the full-screen image. I have also included some GCD code in the UIImagePickerController delegate methods, to help improve memory performances.
